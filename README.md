## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Intelligent Search Strategy:** Prioritizes scraping official websites before moving to social media to get the most accurate data first.
- **Efficient & Cost-Effective:** Automatically halts searching for a person as soon as the goal (email + phone) is met, reducing redundant API calls.
- **API Call Limiter:** Set a hard cap on API searches in the `.env` file to prevent unexpected costs.
- **Automated Email Outreach:** Can send personalized introductory emails via Gmail upon successful contact discovery.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generates three timestamped reports in a `/reports` folder for each run:
  1. `output_with_contacts_[timestamp].xlsx`: The master list of all contacts found.
  2. `emails_sent_log_[timestamp].xlsx`: A log of every email sent by the agent.
  3. `platform_effectiveness_report_[timestamp].xlsx`: An analysis of which platforms yielded the most contacts.
